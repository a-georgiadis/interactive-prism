title: Review of PRISM Ideas
---

## Efficiency Gains
Overall, the PRISM algorithm uses the fact that the frequencies propagated through have a linear response to create efficiencies in computing a large amount of STEM data. Below see a table of the step by step comparison of what is being done in a traditional vs multislice methodology.

(Insert a table or figure which shows the different complexity next to it)

## Main Takeaways
The ideas that are necessary to make that happen are a good understanding of fourier manipulations in the frequency domain and how to translate between each of those steps.

(Make a powerpoint diagram to show how we can propagate through the system using STEM with a representative TEM diagram next to it)
