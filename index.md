Simulating STEM images at atomic resolution for samples with realistic dimensions is computationally intensive using traditional algorithms. The PRISM algorithm bridges the gap between the Bloch wave and multislice methods, offering a highly efficient approach for STEM simulations. By introducing a Fourier interpolation factor $f$, with typical values of $f=2â€“20$ for atomic-resolution imaging, PRISM achieves speedups that scale as $f^2$ to $f^4$, compared to standard multislice methods, with minimal loss of accuracy. In this interactive demonstration paper, we help readers explore the principles behind the PRISM algorithm, understand how it achieves simulation speedups, and visualize the trade-offs between speed and accuracy.

This article is an interactive reimagining of the peer-reviewed manuscript [A fast image simulation algorithm for scanning transmission electron microscopy](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40679-017-0046-1).
