# Overview

Historically, there have been two primary methods used to simulate elastic scattering of electrons interacting with a sample in a TEM:
1. The Bloch wave method.
2. The mutlislcie methods.

For the reader interested in understanding more about these please see the [Kirkland Textbook](doi:10.1007/978-1-4419-6533-2), as we will primarily do an overview of the principles and primary limitations of each algorithm. In both algorithms, the goal is to compute how the electron wavefunction evolves as it progresses through a three-dimensional sample.
