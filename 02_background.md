# Overview
Historically, there have been two primary methods, Bloch Wave and Multislice, for simulating the diffraction patterns generated by the elastic scattering of electrons interacting with a sample in a TEM. For the reader interested in understanding more about these please see, the Kirkland Textbook, as we will primarily do an overview of the principles and primary limitations of each algorithm. In both algorithms, the goal is to compute how the electron wavefunction evolves as it progresses through three-dimensional space.
